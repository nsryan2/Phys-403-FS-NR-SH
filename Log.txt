Day 2

Overall Goal
------------


Daily Goal
----------
Frequency domain analysis of Ruby samples

Settings
--------
1. Function generator : Square wave, 4 V_pp, 10 Hz, 2 V_dc offset.

2. f-domain software : Delay constant: 2, frequency range: 1-150Hz, 100points, measured harmonic number: 1. 


Timeline
--------
1-1:30 PM:
* Theory overview of frequency domain
Frequency domain for ruby 1

1:30-2 PM:
* Frequency domain for rubies 2/3
* Plotted intensity v/s wavelength graphs for all four rubies. Rubies 3 and 6 show strongest evidence of the existence of a second energy level.

2-2:30 PM:
* Frequency domain for ruby 6

2:30-3 PM:
* LED reading.

3-4 PM: Tea Time

Lecture on ferroelectrics.

4-5 PM:
* Ruby 6 reading taken again, since first 17 readings were not meaningful.
* LED results did not match expected shape of Modulation v. frequency plots, so it was recorded once again. 
* Attempted to plot the modulation and phase v/s frequency graphs for the four different samples.

Daily Goal
----------
Temperature domain analysis of the ruby 1. Data analysis of rubies from frequency and time domains.

Settings
--------
1. 10 hz, same as frequency domain.


Timeline
--------
1-1:30 PM:
* Setup cryostat and insert sample into it.
* Increase the temperature to 450 K with a ramp speed of 1000.
* Once it gets there we'll cool it down with liquid nitrogen to 100 K taking snapshots throughout so we can build a curve from the points.

1:30-3:00 PM:
* Looked at the data from the frequency domain and attempted a fit. Results are below:

Ruby 2
C = 1.00115 ± 0.04864
alpha = 0.69318 ± 0.31225
tau1 = 0.00457 ± 3.93261E-4
tau2 = 0.00328 ± 5.04714E-4
s=1

Ruby 6
C = 1.68863 ± 0.0249
alpha = 0.89484 ± 0.00187
tau1 = 0.00404 ± 1.11777E-5
tau2 = 8.51214E-4 ± 1.42379E-5
s = 1 

Rubies 1/3 fit displayed weird behaviour; large error in alpha value and same value for tau1 and tau2. The reason for this has not yet been discerned, but it was observed that
there was a jump discontinuity around 100Hz in the LED phase plot. This also indicated to us that we may have to retake data for these samples.

An analysis of the data from the wavelength domain was also conducted.

3-4 PM: Tea Time and journal club presentations on physics of "juiced" baseballs and corked bats; lead-acid battery recycling. 

4-5pm:

Finished up temperature domain analysis for ruby 1. Attempted to correct the errors seen with the fit, not to much success however.

Daily Goal
----------


Settings
--------
1. f-domain software : Delay constant: 2, frequency range: 1-150Hz, 100points, measured harmonic number: 1. 

## Determined that ruby 1 has one lifetime, rubies 2/3/6 have two.

Timeline
--------
1-1:30 PM:
Keeping ruby at the same temperature (start at ~295).

1:30-2 PM:
Second run at temperature, T=350K.

2-3 PM:
* Waiting for temperature to stabilize and 

3-4 PM: Tea Time

4-4:30 PM:
Third run at temperature, T=400K.

4:30-5 PM:
*





Lowering temperature, don't restart!!!
